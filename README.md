# Sound-of-silence

This is the README for my sound of silence repository. Also, this is my first GitHub Repo!

## What this repo is about

The goal here is to create an app that helps with people who listen to loud music on their headphones for an unhealthy amount of time.
An app can help monitor volume of sound being played and gradually moderate excessive/high volume prolonged sound after a prescribed amount of time.
The volume reduction is done in small decrements such that customers can't really tell until it is too late (the volume is now normal)! :)

Need I say more?
